# H0-Tension-Redshift-Plot
Intended as a companion plot to the publicly available whisker plot code of Di Valentino et al, showing the trend of H_0 measurements with redshift.

- The .py source file plots from the exaggerated .csv data file. Note that the smaller redshift ranges for CMB and GW measurements are exaggerated for visibility - I include the original .csv purely for comparison.
- You can introduce a cut-off of data by precision, date, or number of measurements per category in the .py source file.
- You can sort the order of plotting manually by category or automatically plot the data with lowest error bars on top by setting the sort to 'manual' or 'automatic'.
- Sample plots with and without cutoff are included.
- If you use this code please reference my paper!
